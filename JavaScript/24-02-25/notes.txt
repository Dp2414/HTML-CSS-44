global,fuction and block 
we should avoid using var because it is not a block scope 
 rules of creating variables:-
 var:- var is function-scoped when declared inside a function and global-scoped when declared outside any function. It can be re-declared and reassigned within the same scope.


 let:= it is a block-scoped ,Variables are accessible only inside the {} block where they are declared.
 ot can be reassigned but cannot be redeclared.

 const:-const is used to create constants, it cant be reassigned or redeclared,it has to assign a value at the time of declaration

 ==============Data Types=============
 what are data types ?
 data type means what type of data is being used

 data types has been categorized in two ways and they are:
 1.primitive 
 2.Non-Primitive(user defined)

 Es5 vs Es6
 ES5-var and ES6-Let ,Const
 ES5-five primitive and ES6-Symbol and bigInt

 Non-primitive datatype
 1.array
 2.object
 3.Function 

 everything in js is an object only

1.Array:-
An array in JavaScript is a type of global object used to store data. Arrays can store multiple values in a single variable, which can condense and organize our code

array index value always starts from "0"
object: key and value
